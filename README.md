# FPGA Cosmac ELF
This is re-creation of a cosmic ELF computer, Coded in SpinalHDL.

The main goal of this project is to end up with a near cycle accurate 1802 core made using SpinalHDL.

Clone this project into your source folder of your FPGA project, when SpinalHDL generates the Verilog file/s it will place them into the folder this is cloned into.
