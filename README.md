# FPGA Cosmac ELF
This re-creation of a cosmic ELF computer, Coded in SpinalHDL.

The main goal of this project is to end up with a near cycle accurate 1802 core and while using SpinalHDL.
It's other purpose is to give beginners a simple but complex project to play with, so that they can start to learn and work with SpinalHDL.

I'm also new to SpinalHDL myself, as of writing this.  And at the time could not find a simple project to tinker with.
So maybe it will be of use to you in learning SpinalHDL.
